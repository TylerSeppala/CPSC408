Final Project

This project, titled AudioStation, is a Django based web application that allows users to collaborate on music projects.
The application resembles a social media app, where projects take the form of posts. Users can download audio files
associated with these projects, add their own twist, and reupload. The program automatically tags all users involved
in a collab when it is uploaded.

Certain functionality can only be accessed through a Super User account, so I made you your own personal login:
        Username: rene
        Password: testing321

For the starting point of this project, I referenced the following series: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UmljXZIypDc
Everything else is my own original code, which I learned to write from a variety of articles and videos. 

For a more detailed description of the app, see the full report.
